# geoshaclrules
This repository extends GeoSHACL constraints initially defined by https://github.com/chrdebru/chrdebru.github.io/tree/master/ontologies/geoshacl
and defines new SHACL inference rules which are intended to enrich a GeoSPARQL graph.

These shapes are intended to be used with GeoSPARQL 1.1 and not all shapes will work with a GeoSPARQL 1.0 implementation.
